         The more you know: Identity management in the Power Platform
        </h1>

      <div class="post-content">
        <p>Sometimes you misunderstand how a product is designed, which can lead to insecure defaults. This definitely happened to me recently with the Power Pages product.</p>
        <p>This is the story of how a simple anti-pattern in Power Platform identity management might lead you to expose authenticated pages to unexpected people.</p>

        <hr>

        <h2>The setup</h2>
        <p>The architecture is pretty straightforward. When you create Power Pages, they are part of an "environment". It is standard practice to have an environment shared between many sites.</p>
        <p>You might have a dev environment and a production environment for your corp, for example.</p>
        <p>Some pages can be protected by the "Authenticated Users" role. This is the default setting to protect pages.</p>
        <p>You might want to put internal pages here, perhaps an internal wiki or something restricted to partners. As a security measure, you disable "open registration" which is a site level setting. You may naturally assume that because open registration is closed, nobody from the internet can access those pages.</p>

        <div style="max-width: fit-content; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
            <img style="width: 50%; height: auto;" src="/Proofs/blog6/Authenticated_Users.png" />
            <div>"Authenticated users" default role</div>
        </div>
        <br>
        <div style="max-width: fit-content; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
            <img style="width: 50%; height: auto;" src="/Proofs/blog6/Open_Registration.png" />
            <div>"Open registration" page level settings that control if an anonymous usercan create a new local user account</div>
        </div>

        <h2>So, what's up?</h2>
        <p>Here is the catch: registration work at the environment level.</p>
        <p>This assumption holds true only if you don't have other sites that are meant to be public in the same environment.</p>
        <p>I was really surprised to learn that even if you close open registration on Site A, a user can still be registered cross-site if they register on Site B within the same environment. Because the identity lives at the environment level, they are technically an "Authenticated User" for both.</p>
        <p>This doesn't seem to be a vulnerability on Microsoft's side; it is a product design choice. However, it is a nuance that is easy to miss and that might create dangerous gap between expectation and reality. I wanted to share this so nobody else makes the same assumptions I did.</p>
          <div style="max-width: fit-content; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;">
            <img style="width: 75%; height: auto;" src="/Proofs/blog6/the-more-you-know.gif" />
          </div>

        <h2>The conclusion</h2>
        <p>As usual, always make sure your threat model is in line with your provider's actual architecture.</p>
        <p>Do not forget to test security assumptions internally or delegate that to a trusted partner. And, I guess, don't trust the GUI implicitly.</p>
        <p>Oh, and maybe the solution would be to eventually put the "Disable Open Registration" option as an environment setting and not a site setting as the mechanic actually affects the environment and not the site.</p>
        <p>Thanks for reading everyone!</p>
